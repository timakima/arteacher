AR Physics Teacher

Copyright (C) 2012 University of Helsinki

Introduction
============

AR Physics Teacher is an application prototype that demonstrates physics 
experiments through augmented reality models and animations.

Currently it contains a demo application for Boltzmann constant.
One marker demonstrates a thermometer with display and blue gas animation,
other marker a freezer and third one a stove. Placing thermometer near
either of the other markers changes temperature and gas velocity.

You can print the markers yourself. They are under /marker -directory.

This software includes marker tracking parts of ARToolkit:

Install
=======

Requirements for compiling the code are:
* Qt >= 4.7.4
* QtQuick3D (Tested with 2011-09-14)
* OpenCV 2.x

It's been running on W7, OS X and Linux, although W7 is the
only supported platform. Linux seems to have by far the best
performance...

Known issues & TODO
===================
* QGLView renders on top of InfoWidget in Mac OS X
* Build is a bit hacky (hardcoded paths for Windows)
* Some widgets could be replaced by pure qss
* UI auto-testing missing
* Camera & graphics aren't really optimized at all (it works
  well enough for current purpose)
* Some hardcoded positioning for 3D models should be fixed

Contact
=======
Any (constructive) feedback will be appreciated.
